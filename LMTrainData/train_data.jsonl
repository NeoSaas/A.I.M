Secondary Demographic - The home seller themselves. - We haven't targeted this market yet, but we have very good data on who recently sold their homes in markets that are attractive to us. - The most attractive audience for us on sellers are higher earners and/or high net worth home sellers. - They might have built up equity in their homes & don't want to be bothered by problems with their home after they sell it. - I think the two big buckets are transient homeowners who move to new cities for work after a few years and retirees looking to down-size after their kids move out. Pain Points - Agents are mostly concerned about not losing a current client, and second to that is getting new clients. - They spend so much time prospecting & often only convert about 2% of their leads to clients, so once they get a client, they're very worried about someone involved in the deal screwing the deal up. - The hard part for them is discerning what makes their life better, because they're sales people, not operators. - They also get their best clients from referrals, so they don't want a deal that closes to be a bad experience for their clients, or they risk future referrals....though this is less important than losing any current deal. - Brokers are focused on their broker profitability and reputation.  They've been in real estate a long time typically and get a lot of business through word of mouth referrals. - They also pay a lot in what's called E&O insurance (errors and omissions) - about $5K per agent that works for them per year. Fears - Agents - afraid of failing and having to get a 9-5 job. - For the top performers, they're worried their lead volume might dry up or go somewhere else. - It would be embarrassing for a good agent to not know something that their client knows about real estate, or their client thinks they should \t  know about real estate. - For brokers, they're typically making almost all their money off their own sales, even though they might have 10, 20, 40 agents that work for them. - The cost and people management overhead is a drag, and it's not very profitable for most brokers. - They want to avoid anything that will destroy the reputation of their whole brokerage. Goals 1) Most good agents want to be mega rich without having to work hard.  We call it the maserati mindset.  Max cash with min effort.  You tend to want other realtors to know how successful you are as well.  Desire for peer appreciation is very high, and the junior ranks really idolize top industry performers. 2) Lack of training & accountability are the biggest roadblocks, because they're all 1099, which makes it harder for anyone to hold them accountable for sales activities that you'd see in a corporation.  So agents have to be self-motivated without oversight to succeed.  Also, real estate training is a big profit engine in the industry, so agents can't get unbiased advice on training, so they don't know what can/can't be trusted in the advice they get.  Lastly, unlike sales pros in other industries, the agents typically have to choose and manage all their own services and tools - how to get leads, where to buy them, what crm to put them in, what campaigns to build to communicate to them, phone services, accounting and tax services, etc.  It's overwhelming. 3) See above.  They have to have/use tools that any competitive sales industry would need, but it's hard to cut through the clutter on what crm's, call screening services, mileage tracking tools, mls services, lead gen services, etc would work best for you.  To put a bow on this, 90% of agents usually fail out of the industry in their first 2 years after getting their license, so those that make it to the top of the industry and are targets for Sellers Shield service are in the small minority. Solution 1) Reduces deal friction - the agent can email their client a link to fill out their sellers disclosure form on Sellers Shield rather than a fillable PDF or printed document.  Sellers Shield will also let the agent know when the client has completed the form, saving the agent time & energy. 2) Avoids E&O risk - agents are constantly reminded by their brokers not to answer any questions about the sellers disclosure form, because it puts their brokerage in legal jeopardy.  But agents feel bad sitting with a client and not answering their questions or offering any value.  Sellers Shield actually offers advice through the process and helps the clients answer the questions in a way that reduces their risk by almost 90%, including word selection that is less likely to cause legal risks later.  So agents not only spend less time with clients on this part of the legal documentation of selling their home, they also provide better service for their clients vs traditional sellers disclosure form options. Key Benefits 1) It's effective at saving time for agents and measurably reduces risk for clients and brokers. 2) The only competitor in the industry was recently acquired by a large brokerage (Compass Real Estate) and no longer offers their service to non-Compass agents. Competitors None really.  The current competitors are fillable PDF's that don't/can't offer legal advice on the process. Market Alternatives None of the alternatives reduce lawsuit risks from the current levels, and they usually require a bigger time commitment from agents, and the deeper time commitment increases the agent's/broker's legal risk.  So really an agent wants to make sure that the sellers disclosure form gets filled out as quickly as possible, so they can represent the client.  If that can happen quickly without their involvement, they're very happy, and the client is better off.  Our problem is awareness - not all agents know about the service (because it's relatively new) & education - because agents are typically distrustful of new services that might screw up their deals. Brand Highlights Our mission is to put an end to real estate lawsuits Our founder spent 30 years representing agents in real estate lawsuits before launching Sellers Shield to reduce sellers disclosure lawsuits, which is the most common part of the transaction that leads to legal disputes. So we know what elements of the sellers disclosure form are likely to lead to legal disputes, and we've built our form guidance around fixing those areas for each client before they become a problem. Key Talking Points We prevent 88% of sellers disclosure lawsuits It saves them time and is more convenient than their current sellers disclosure process It delivers better legal advice to their clients than their allowed to provide Past Creative Already shared.
