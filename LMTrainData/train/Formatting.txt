Unless specifically stated, we need to include 8x total angles (4 Scripts, 4 Editor Frameworks) with notes for the editors.
Scripted Ads (1-4)
1. Create Four Scripted Ads
- Develop four different scripts for creators to film and read.
- Avoid using similar scripts; each angle should be distinct and not a minor variation of another.
- Examples of Scripted Ads-
- Ad 1: Three reasons why [product/service] is beneficial.
- Ad 2: A product demonstration showcasing its features.
- Ad 3: A personal testimonial sharing user experience.
- Ad 4: An interview or podcast discussing the product/service.
- Include Text Overlay Hooks-
- Provide 3 text overlay hook options for each ad.
Low Hanging Fruit / Editor Frameworks (Ads 5-8)
1. Develop Four Additional Ad Angles
- Utilize existing footage from the shot list your requested.
- No new scripting is required for these angles.
- Each angle should have its own unique framework (e.g., social proof ad).
- Include Text Overlay Hooks-
- Provide 3 text overlay hook options for each ad.
2. Incorporate Reviews and Visuals
- Include reviews or other text that can be used as an overlay.
- Provide a visual guide or notes for editors to understand the direction.
3. Ensure Relevance of Footage
- If a chosen framework requires specific footage not requested in the initial shot list, add it to ensure relevance.
Additional Tips
- Reanalyze the scripts, they should flow well, and not sound too “ad-like”.
- Always use contractions where possible and add transition words.
- Always ensure that each angle, whether scripted or using a framework, is unique and brings a different perspective or message about the product/service.
- Utilize internal resources to find frameworks that can be used for angles 5-8.
- Ensure that all text overlays, visuals, and scripts are coherent and align with the overall message and branding of the ad campaign.
- Even if a visual guide is not always necessary, always include the three text overlay hook options.
