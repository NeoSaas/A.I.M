Script -
Alright, so remember those college days when you thought dropping $10 on a teeny-tiny cup of coffee was a genius move? I mean, if it cost that much, it had to be good, right? *It definitely wasn’t.* I stumbled across this coffee concentrate from Javy, and you guys…. it’s so good. It’s also so easy to make. If I can do it during those half-asleep mornings, literally anyone can. It takes me seconds in the morning, I add it to water or milk, and top it off with my favorite creamer - it’s the perfect morning pick-me-up. And their protein coffee? Game changing. I haaatee regular protein shakes, they’re so bland and chalky. But this? It's smooth, delicious, and packs a punch with 10 grams of protein. Like, who knew adulting could taste this good? I love drinking this in the morning before my workout, it helps me hit my protein goals while giving me long-lasting energy. I’m seriously in love with Javy, their coffee tastes so fresh, so rich, and saves me so much money and time. And as crazy as this sounds, I think I’m ditching coffee shops for good.

- Verb
1. You. guys. It's literally been a week since I've been hooked on these caffeinated energy bars and let me tell you - I have never felt so energized, like I can literally take on the world. Ok exaggeration there, but honestly you can probably relate with me - I hit my morning classes at school, then I head straight to work, and by 9PM I'm just *exhausted*. I’d resort to coffee to keep me up for my studies, but honestly… major red flag for me - I’d get soooo jittery from it that I wouldn't be able to concentrate. So here's how I made the switch from coffee, to **Verb’s *new* caffeinated energy bar.** I think I discovered the best protein bar on the planet. These literally just came out and I am obsessed with them. 200 calories, 10g of protein, no artificial ingredients, dairy-free, and caffeinated of organic green tea, which is equivalent to one espresso shot! I usually keep these energy bars in my bag, so that it's super easy to grab one for a quick boost. It's the best way to kickstart my day. I've ditched the coffee because guess what, I stay full throughout my day and my energy has just been smoooth. I’m so thankful that Verb created a bar that allows me to stay energized - try it for yourself, and experience that healthy boost you deserve!
2. Reasons why YOU should make the switch to Verb’s caffeinated energy bar! I showed up at a new coffee shop last week and they tried to charge me $6 for a latte. I literally walked out. Verb Bars have as much caffeine as a shot of espresso and they’re just over $1 per bar! I'm always on the move, whether I'm running or catching up on work - so these bars are a convenient way to break your habit of consuming unhealthy snacks that don't serve *any* purpose. With Verb’s energy bar, I can get the boost I need in a smooth and natural way, because these bars are made with Green Tea and real ingredients like oats and quinoa. This is legit my third bar of the day – it's their Chocolate Chip Banana Bread flavor. They're insanely good… It’s so possible to be on the move and still be healthy. With Verb I'm the most productive version of myself. My next batch of flavors is already on the way - check Verb out yourself and stay energized, in the most wholesome way.
3. I don't know about you, but I'm so sick of feeling bad about myself for always wanting to drink Celsius or red bull. They make me feel great at first - and then it hits 2pm and the only thing I want to do is take a nap. I crash so hard. I feel like I finally found the cure to my energy drink addiction - and I'm so excited to share this caffeinated energy bar from **Verb**. I know, what even is that?! Verb makes these absolutely delicious snack bars caffeinated with organic green tea. These bars are pocket-sized, meaning you can always get that boost of energy wherever, whenever.  I mean I got it right here, let me try it for you all. Look at the texture - it practically tastes like cookie dough. It's pretty crazy that a single bar packs as much caffeine as an espresso shot, all while staying at just 110 calories! Can you imagine all the money you spend, and all those extra calories you take in by buying one drink a day? I’m just glad I found a way to give myself that natural boost, without having to wait in line *and* spend constantly. Soooo that’s that, I've moved on from caffeinated drinks - Verb caffeinated energy bars are the way to go.
