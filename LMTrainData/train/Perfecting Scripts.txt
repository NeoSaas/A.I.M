Perfecting Scripts
Once you’ve crafted the scripts, begin to edit/tweak to perfect them.
- Read each script aloud to ensure that they read seamlessly, have transition words, and don’t sound too “salesy”.
- Important Things to Remember when Scripting
- Each script should include a Hook + CTA
- The most important part of the video is the first ~3 seconds, also known as “the hook”
- Hook Checklist:
- [ ]  Does it either move away from pain OR towards pleasure?
- [ ]  Does the hook speak directly to the ICP (*ideal customer persona*)?
- [ ]  Can you tell it’s an ad from the hook? (*do people actually talk like this?*)
- [ ]  Did you use contractions whenever possible? (*e.g. NOT using “I am”, “We are”, “I would”, INSTEAD using “I’m”, “We’re”, “I’d”*)
- If there’s a discount / special, that’s typically the best performing CTA’s.
- CTA Checklist:
-Is the CTA congruent with the landing page (e.g. for email signup landing pages - does the CTA include ‘sign-up’?)
-Did you use contractions whenever possible? (*e.g. NOT using “I am”, “We are”, “I would”, INSTEAD using “I’m”, “We’re”, “I’d”*)
- Refer to the Client’s notes in the Onboarding form and ensure you are hitting the most important points.
- Keep each script in the 30-40 second range.
- Transition words are a must - not all creators know that they need to add them when delivering, so be sure to break each paragraph up with smooth transition words.
- Always use contractions where possible - feels more authentic.
